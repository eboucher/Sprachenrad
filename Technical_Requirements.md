# Technical Requirements

**User Authentication and Authorization:**
- Implement a user registration and login system with proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Differentiate between regular users and administrators with different levels of access and permissions.

**Database Management:**
- Choose a suitable database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for storing user data, dictionary entries, and other relevant information.
- Design the database schema to efficiently handle data storage and retrieval.

**RESTful API Design:**
- Create a well-defined RESTful API for frontend-backend communication.
- Use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for different operations.
- Follow RESTful API best practices and adhere to standard conventions.

**Validation and Error Handling:**
- Implement input validation to ensure data integrity and prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
- Handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to users.

**Security Measures:**
- Apply security best practices to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
- Consider implementing measures like encryption, secure token handling, and protecting against common web vulnerabilities.

**Responsive Frontend Design:**
- Develop a responsive frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks to provide a seamless experience across devices of varying screen sizes.

**API Documentation:**
- Provide comprehensive documentation for your API, including endpoint descriptions, request/response examples, and required headers.

**Caching and Performance Optimization:**
- Implement caching mechanisms to improve application performance and reduce database queries.
- Consider using tools like Redis for caching frequently accessed data.

**Asynchronous Processing:**
- Use asynchronous processing for time-consuming tasks, such as sending emails or processing large datasets, to avoid blocking the main application thread.

**Logging and Monitoring:**
- Integrate logging mechanisms to track application behavior, errors, and events.
- Consider using monitoring tools to gain insights into application performance and identify bottlenecks.

**Testing and Test Automation:**
- Write unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of your application.
- Automate test execution to facilitate continuous integration and deployment.

**Scalability and Load Balancing:**
- Design your application architecture with scalability in mind to handle increasing user loads.
- Consider using load balancing techniques to distribute incoming traffic among multiple server instances.

**Containerization and Orchestration:**
- Containerize your application using Docker to ensure consistent deployment across different environments.
- Consider using Kubernetes or a similar orchestration tool for managing and scaling containers.
